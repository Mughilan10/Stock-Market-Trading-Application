# Stock-Market-Trading-Application

This is a simple stock market trading simulator which demonstrates the basic processes involved in the stock markets. Doubly linked list(DLL) and AVL tree data structures are used to implement this project. There are provisions to access the system as an user or as the admin. The default password for the admin is "1234". 

  The admin can insert, delete, or update stock values, view stock details of various companies and also the stocks bought by the users.
  
  The users are assigned login credentials to make transactions if they are new, which can be used to buy or sell stocks by viewing available stocks. They can also view the     stocks bought and can delete their account.
